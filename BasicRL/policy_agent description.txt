The policy agent implementation defines a reinforcement learning agent which learns a policy to select actions given a state
based on experience gained through running the agent within the environment

1. defining the model of the policy

the policy is modelled as a feed forward neural network of an arbitrary number of layers which can be specified through
giving the dimensions of all the layers

2. Derive the loss function

The loss function is computed as the gradient of the log policy multiplied by the advantage of being in the state, which
in this state is just the reward obtained after arriving in the state.

* the policy itself is computed selecting output neurons from the
